# Art-Generation-with-Neural-Style-Transfer
Using TF Keras to build a VGG19 network for art generation via neural style transfer.

** Note: the file `pre-trained model` could not be uploaded to GitHub **

## Objectives
- Implement the neural style transfer algorithm 
- Generate novel artistic images using your algorithm 
- Define the style cost function for Neural Style Transfer
- Define the content cost function for Neural Style Transfer
